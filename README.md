# plotters-conrod

This is an implementation of a Conrod backend for Plotters. This is more efficient than using the default Bitmap backend when plotting in Conrod, as it has been observed that Conrod was quite inefficient at re-rendering images at high FPS (eg. for real-time plotting).

## What is Plotters?

Plotters is an extensible Rust drawing library that can be used to plot data on nice-looking graphs, rendering them through a plotting backend (eg. to a Bitmap image raw buffer, to your GUI backend, to an SVG file, etc.).

**For more details on Plotters, please check the following links:**

## How to install?

Include `plotters-conrod` in your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
plotters-conrod = "0.3.0"
```

## Run the examples

### `cpu-monitor`

This example samples your CPU load every second, and renders it in real-time charts:

```sh
cargo run --release --example cpu-monitor
```

_The first plot uses the default Bitmap backend as a reference, while the second plot uses `plotters-conrod`. This can be used to compare the output and performance of both plotting backends._
