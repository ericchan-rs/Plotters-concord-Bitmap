# plotters-conrod

This is an implementation of a Conrod backend for Plotters. This is more efficient than using the default Bitmap backend when plotting in Conrod, as it has been observed that Conrod was quite inefficient at re-rendering images at high FPS (eg. for real-time plotting).

## What is `plotters`?

Plotters is an extensible Rust drawing library that can be used to plot data on nice-looking graphs, rendering them through a plotting backend (eg. to a Bitmap image raw buffer, to your GUI backend, to an SVG file, etc.).
